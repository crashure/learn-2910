## Course description
Students will analyze, design and implement an IT project as a group, 
and apply the core technical knowledge acquired in the program so far. 
The course is focused on developing teamwork, project planning and project management skills.

(Note: This course is only required for students who are not doing Co-op after Term 2a.) 

## Course goals
Students will undertake a moderate team project, using unfamiliar technology. 
They will apply the core technical knowledge acquired in the program so far, 
but they can only complete the project easily by collaborating with their team members.

## Course learning outcomes / competencies

Upon successful completion of the course, the student will be able to:
- Determine and document project requirements.
- Plan and schedule project work tasks.
- Work effectively with a team to meet stated tasks and milestones.
- Design a system that meets the documented requirements.
- Implement a system that has been designed.
- Test and deliver a working system.

## Evaluation criteria
Team work - 30% ... Team agreement; daily process review; project review    
Collaboration tool usage - 30% ...  Deliverables: project plan, project prototype, 
functional project, project presentation; project review  
Online repository - 40% -  Process reviews; repository inspection; project review

On completion of each agile development iteration (beginning or end of a week), 
each team will complete a self-assessment of their progress towards and 
application of the learning outcomes, and review this with their instructor.

## Attendance requirements
Lab/seminar attendance is expected. Missing more than two classes may result 
in a grade of unsatisfactory in the course.


## Learning resources

- D2L, for submitting work and reviews, and for getting instructor feedback.
- Git client, to use team and member repositories on the CIT Gitlab server. Freely downloadable.
- Team collaboration tools, such as: Trello, PivotalTracker, Jabber, Webex, Jenkins, Ansible. 
These are either free for student use, or they have trial versions that would expire past the end of the course.
- Additional tools may be appropriate, depending on the projects undertaken.


## Course specific requirements

The expected workload for this course is one hour out-of-class for each timetabled hour. 
The expectation is that a student will spend one hour on the assigned reading 
and related quiz/questionnaire, and two hours collaborating on their assignment(s).

Session readings will be assigned, starting with the second session, following a “flipped” learning model.
Students are to read these lessons and answer a quiz/questionnaire, 
by the evening before that session/seminar. 

Some labs are individual, while others will use pair programming. 
Pairings may be randomly assigned. Many of these will have starter projects, on github. 
The usual submission, if needed, will be a readme file in a D2L dropbox, 
containing a link to the students' github/gitlab repository they used to complete the work. 
Lab grading will be by rubric, and team members do not have to receive the same grade. 
Lab work is meant to be completed during the lab period, with time available 
to apply the lab's outcomes to the students' assignments.

Assignments will be completed in student-selected project teams of 4-5 members. 
The same team will be used for all assignments. 
If a student does not have a team, they will be assigned one by the instructor. 
Team members' grades are commensurate with their contribution, 
as well as performance assessed by an assignment rubric. 
Team submissions will be in the form of a readme file in a D2L dropbox, 
with a link to the team's github/gitlab repository for their project.

Course materials (lessons, examples, tutorials, labs and assignments) will be shared 
through the course “hub” website. Lab and assignment feedback will be provided 
through the D2L dropboxes that readme files are submitted to. 
The D2L gradebook will be useful only to review D2L-captured grade components, 
and it will not provide an accurate final grade in the course.

Students who miss class for an acceptable reason will be excused from attendance and 
quiz/questionnaire completion, should those fall during the excused period. 
Missed readings or lab work will need to be made up by the student.

## Course Topics

The intended delivery strategy is to hold three seminars each week of the course (Mon/Tue/Thu), 
except for the last week, which will be Tue/Thu/Fri because of Easter Monday . 
Each seminar day, the students will have an online lesson to complete the day before (motivation), 
a three hour seminar with their instructor (guidance), and 
three hours of unsupervised collaboration to work on their project as a team (practice), 
with remote access to their instructor (mentor).

The project that the students undertake will be completed using agile development practices. 
There will be five one-week iterations, most of which will result in a 
deliverable for the project, as shown bolded in the course schedule above.

The individuals and teams will conduct a daily process review, an iteration 
review between iterations, and a project review at the end of the course. 
These will be assessed by the instructor, providing additional comments and guidance.
