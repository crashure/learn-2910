**Session 10** *(Sun May 14, 17:30)*  
Today's lab writeup is complete. I have opened a "session 10" survey for
you to let me know what, if anything, you would like me to address
at the beginning of our class today, before diving into the lab. 
It closes at noon, to give me a chance to collect my thoughts.

**Note**: the survey asks if you have any questions before Thursday's lab, and it should say Monday's lab,
but D2L is giving me the gears, and I give up trying to fix it :-/
The question really does apply to Monday's lab!!

During lab today, we plan to meet with each team and go over
your progress, as well as your testing.

**Temporary Facility Closure** Wed May 24  
The 5th floor learning space(s) will be unavailable all day May 24th, for furniture delivery and installation.
