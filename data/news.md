**Session 8** *(Tue May 9, 10:20)*   
My original schedule called for "Project build out" as the theme for session 8.
That is being deferred until later, because we **really** need to talk
about testing and some sort of test plan. That is a topic/theme
that will influence how you build your project out!

I have posted a lesson and an accompanying lab. 
I was hoping to have the lesson ready much earlier, with a survey so you could
ask questions, but I ended up redoing what I had in mind, pretty much from scratch :-/

I will field questions in class, and today will be more "traditional", with an opening 
lecture.

**Temporary Facility Closure** Wed May 24  
The 5th floor learning space(s) will be unavailable all day May 24th, for furniture delivery and installation.
