**Session 5-6** *(Fri May 5, 09:10)*   
I did an [analysis](/display/lab/sad-story-results) of the Sad Story repo :-/

**Project** *(Thu May 4 02:30)*  
I took a quick look through all of your Trello boards.  
Some of the groups are using them for brainstorming, and to
record non-code issues or decisions (eg design) - good to see.  
Some don't appear to have been visited since last week. Are you
using a different tool to share non-code documents?

**Temporary Facility Closure** Wed May 24  
The 5th floor learning space(s) will be unavailable all day May 24th, for furniture delivery and installation.
