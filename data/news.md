**Project** *(Thu May 4 02:30)*  
I took a quick look through all of your Trello boards.  
Some of the groups are using them for brainstorming, and to
record non-code issues or decisions (eg design) - good to see.  
Some don't appear to have been visited since last week. Are you
using a different tool to share non-code documents?
