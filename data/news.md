**Session 9** *(Thu May 11, too early)*  
I am editing the lab writeup and screenshots, possibly at the very moment
you are reading this! I will post it when ready, and open a survey for
you to let me know what, if anything, you would like me to address
at the beginning of our class today, before diving into the lab.

_Finally got the integration working ... will test again in the morning
and update the writeup._

I have also posted a reading for you - my approach to building out
a project. There are no expectations or changes for your project
that would arise from it ... it is more of a _campfire story_
that I hope you will find informative.

You think you've got it bad?
