#Lab session14 - Bug Bounty Attacks
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Goal

You want "customers" to test your apps!!

##"Customer" Feedback Sessions

We will run 15 minute sessions, one for each team.
They will happen at 13:30, 13:45, 14:00, 14:30, 14:45, 15:00, 15:30 and 15:45.

The team whose "business" is to be open and available will be advised 
5 minutes before the start of their session.

In preparation, submit a readme, before class, with the link to your deployed app,
to the session14 dropbox.
I will post that in the organizer (in the "news") or else on our Slack channel, one team at a time, when we are ready to "go".

Each class member who is not part of the "open" app team should visit
the site and place an order or two. I suggest one simple order (2 or 3 items)
and one you think could break the app.

##Bug Bounties

If you find a bug in the app you are testing, report it, using
the "bug reports" dropbox. I will filter those by time range, so we know which
app they apply to. Bug reports will be forwarded to the team(s) affected.

Each distinct bug will result in a (very) small points bounty,
awarded to the first student to report the bug, and "paid" for
by the team whose app broke. The awarded bounty is individual, not
for a team.

### Bug reports

For each, identify the kiosk (team) targetted, the URL where the bug is evidenced, 
a description of the problem you encountered, and a screenshot as evidence.

Put these into a suitable folder and submit a zip of it.

##Session Timeline

Each session will run as follows:

- T-5mins The team whose app will be open is notified
- Using sharelink, set one of the media wall displays to the team member manning the kitchen,
one to the team member manning the "office", and two to "customers" who will be
visiting your establishment
- 00:00:00 The "boss" should click the "open for business" button/link, resetting
any on-hand inventory and transaction history, and allowing customers to start ordering
- 00:08:00 The "boss" should click the "closed for business" button/link, preventing any
new orders from being placed.
- 00:10:00 The cook leaves for the day, and any in-progress orders are cancelled.
- 00:10:01 The boss presents the reports for the session, alternating between
the order analytics and the menu item analytics.
- 00:10:02 Customers complete the appropriate survey, with peer feedback for the
team just "open". You will be rating the app for functionality, usability, and performance,
each on a sliding scale; and you can add comments if you like.
- 00:11:00 The next team will have been notified, and will be setting up

##Observers

We are likely to have some guest observers at the event, but I will try to keep that informal
and not distracting.

##Focus

You should all be focused on the testing, and not on attempting to complete
features or fix bugs at the last minute.

In fact, I will insist that there be no changes to your code once the class begins.
If your app is not ready to participate, you will forfeit your "business" opportunity.
There will be no "do overs" or makeup provision.

If teams forfeit, we might have "playoffs", for fun (not marks), between the 
functional apps. 

##Submission

As part of the testing, each student will complete a brief survey
about the other teams' apps. A summary of the surveys for a team
will be provided to them as feedback, probably using the session 14 dropbox.
