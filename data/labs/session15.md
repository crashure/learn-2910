#Lab session15 - Project Presentations  
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Goal

This is your opportunity to present your team and project in their best light :)

##Schedule

We will have 15 minute presentations from each team, at 20 minute intervals,
with a break between the 4th and fifth.

The order will be random, determined by us.

##Presentation Details

This should be a PowerPoint (or equivalent) presentation.

You are welcome to incorporate screenshots or live demos.
This would typically be to highlight the parts of your app
that the audience may not have seen, or parts that you are particularly proud of.

Questions to address:
- what you think you did
- accomplishment(s) you are proud(est) of
- words of wisdom for your current and future classmates
- words of wisdom for your teachers

This is not a BComm presentation - you may chose a spokesperson or two
to lead the presentation, but should all be there for Q&A.

Done or not, you will be cut off at the 15 minute mark, in fairness
to the next group.

##Submission

One member of each team should submit your presentation to the session 15 dropbox.
