#Tutorial tracker-setup - PivotalTracker Setup
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Goal

You want to properly setup PivotalTracker for your project.

Before you start, make sure that your team repository is properly setup.

##Preparation

I am setting up projects for each team, to avoid the 3 collaborators limit on free
accounts.

Each team member will get an invite.

##Captain/General:

Signup for zapier.com, and setup integrations between your team repo
and your tracker project. We want tracker stories to create github issues,
and we want github issues changes to update tracker.

We don't want new github issues (eg for bugs) to trigger corresponding
tracker stories.

##All:

Split up the stories you chose for your project plan, and enter them as tracker stories.
Remember to set the story type and feature points.

Arrange the stories ... drag the ones you plan to handle this iteration into
your backlog.

Re-arrange stories so that the current ones accurately reflect your current/immediate
workload plan.

Make sure that any current stories have owners if they are for specific
team members.



##Submission 

Once your Tracker project is ready to roll, drop a note to the 
session 4 dropbox, to let us know to check out your tracker
and repository.
