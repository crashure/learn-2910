#Lab iteration1-scrum - End of iteration review
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Goal

The end-of-iteration scrum is meant to be a review of the just
concluded iteration, your team practices, and to revisit the
plan for the next iteration.

There are some scrum questions to address, as well as some broader ones, shown below.

##Scrum

Like any scrum, there are several questions to answer:
-    What did you complete during the iteration? (big picture, not a list of tasks)
-    What will you do next iteration? (big picture, not a list of tasks)
-    Are there any impediments in your way? (big or small)

##Teamwork Reflection

- How well is the team functioning together?
- Are you sticking to the team agreement?
- How is the planned workload assignment working? Anything you would change if you could go back in time?
- How is the planned dispute resolution working? Anything you would change if you could go back in time?
- How is the risk assessment turning out? Anything you would change if you could go back in time?
- Are you doing daily process reviews? How are they working out?

##Collaboration Reflection

- How is the project plan working?  Anything you would change if you could go back in time?
- How well is Trello working for collaboration? What would you change?
- How well is PivotalTracker working for agile management? What would you change?
- Have you provided a Trello card for us, identifying your team repository and anything
we need to know to run the app on our systems?

##Repository Reflection

- How well is gitflow working?  What would you change?
- How comfortable is the team with gitflow now? Any stumbling blocks?

##Project Reflection

- How close is what you are building to what you had in mind at the outset of the project?
- Do you have a plan for testing correct behaviour of your app?
- What tool suite are you using to build the app components? (eg nodeJS + ???)
- Which aspects of the project have required design? Have you run these by us?  
Hint: the Trello board would be great for that, with anything to be reviewed clearly
flagged or perhaps in a "Review" list.

##Submission

One member of each team should add a readme note in the session 7 dropbox,
answering the above.
