#Tutorial tracker-setup - Team Repository Setup
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Goal

You want to properly setup the team repository for your project.

I'm still gogin to call the repo maintainer "captain".
if your team has someone else as team leader, I can call them "general".

##Captain:

Create an organization on github or gitlab, for your team.

Within that organization, create a repository for this project.
Make sure it has a readme, and a license.

It will be "the" repository.

Feel free to add your team members, but **do not** give anyone
other than yourself admin rights. Your are the **only person**
who can commit changes to this repo.

Create a develop branch from master.
This is where all "real" work will be done until the end of an iteration.

Make "develop" the default branch.

##All:

Everyone, captain included, should fork the team repo to their personal
accounts. That is the only place you will all work, except when
the captin is merging pull requests.

##CAUTION

Do not commit any code to the team repo until after Session 5.

If you plan to add stuff to your personal repository, in preparation
for the "coming together", **do this in one or more feature branches**.

##Planning

All changes to the team repo shall be through pull requests.

The captain will be setting up integrations with Zapier
and/or PivotalTracker.

##Submission
Part of the next "lab"
