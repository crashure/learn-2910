#Tutorial sad-story - Practicing gitflow
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Goal

This lab is meant to be a fun way of practicing gitflow :)

I have setup a [shared repository](https://github.com/jedi-academy/sad-story) for everyone
to use. Everyone will need to fork it, and clone that locally to work with.
 
Each team member will be contributing fortunately-unfortunately story
segments, two to their team's story, and one to another team's story,
by the time the lab is complete.

##Story Segments

Starter stories have been provided, one for each team.

These have an opening and a conclusion.

Each segment that you add will be injected between one of the
unfortunately-fortunately blocks, and it will consists of
a fortunately-unfortunately reply.

Example before injecting your segment:

    Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

    Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

    Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.

Example after injecting a segment:

    Jack and Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pail of water.

    Unfortunately, Jack tripped over a root.

    Fortunately, Jill was able to use her amazing side vision to
    notice how clumsy Jack was, and she propped him up before he could fall.

    Unfortunately, a Klingon Bird of Prey had chosen that exact
    moment to test fire their latest phaser weapons, targetting the
    very spot where Jack and Jill were teetering.

    Fortunately, not a drop of water was spilled, and the village was saved.

The story doesn't have to be totally sensible, but it has to flow
somewhat. You can have fun creating plausible challenges for the
next story segment creator.

##Round 1

When I give the signal, everyone can start contributing one story segment
**to their team story**. Use gitflow!

At the end of the round, we will merge develop into master and do a "release".

##Round 2

Everyone needs to contribute one story segment **to another team's story**.
Use gitflow, of course.

Make sure that these contributions are signed.

At the end of the round, we will merge develop into master and do a "release".

##Round 3

Everyone should contribute one last story segment to **their team story**,
attempting to repair the "damage" done by other teams trying to 
trip them up :)

Make sure that these contributions are GPG-signed.

At the end of the round, we will merge develop into master and do a final release.

##Submission

One member of each team should add a readme note in the session 5 dropbox,
so that we can provide feedback to you.
