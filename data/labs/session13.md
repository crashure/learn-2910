#Lab session13 - Integration
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Goal

This will be the last end-of-iteration scrum.

We will keep it brief, so as to help you with project completion,
rather than detract from it.

##Submission

One member of each team should add a readme note in the session 13 dropbox,
with your scrum report for the end of iteration 3.
