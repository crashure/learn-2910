#Continuous integration
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Goal

You want to start down the path of continuous integration for testing.

We want to setup travis-ci (or equivalent) integration for your team repository,
and have it perform a couple of tests.

##In lab

There are several links at the end of the [testing](/display/lesson/testing) lesson,
for unit testing and continuous integration.

Have each team member investigate one of the candidate test frameworks and report
back to the team, after say a one-hour "spike". 
You could also have subteams investigate the two or three most
likely testing frameworks, depending on your technology choices so far.

After an hour, review the candidates and pick one.

Split into subteams:
- one should add continuous integration
- one should make sure you have something testable
- one should build a simple unit test (or three) for it

##Submission

Provide a link to your team repo, which now supports continuous integration.

This goes in the session08 dropbox, and is due Weds morning.
