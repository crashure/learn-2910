#Lab iteration2-scrum - End of iteration review
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Goal

The end-of-iteration scrum is meant to be a review of the just
concluded iteration, your team practices, and to revisit the
plan for the next iteration.

There are some scrum questions to address, as well as some broader ones, shown below.

Yes, this should sound familiar to the iteration 1 scrum!

**Note:** with conventional server-side projects, this would be the point
in the project course where the students start getting into deployment 
and hosting, and wiring different components together (the "glue"). 
You have that already, with nodeJS and heroku, so there
is no ahead-of-class reading - just getting ready for the review and
nudging.

##Scrum

Like any scrum, there are several questions to answer:
-    What did you complete during the iteration? (big picture, not a list of tasks)
-    What will you do next iteration? (big picture, not a list of tasks)
-    Are there any impediments in your way? (big or small)

##Teamwork Reflection

- How well is the team functioning together?
- Are you sticking to the team agreement? Anything you would change if you could go back in time?

##Collaboration Reflection

- How is the project plan working?  Anything you would change if you could go back in time?
- **We will take a look at your Trello board and PivotalTracker project & offer our observations
and/or suggestions**

##Repository Reflection

- How well is gitflow working?  What would you change?
- How comfortable is the team with gitflow now? Any stumbling blocks?
- **We will take a look at your team repository & offer our observations
and/or suggestions**

##Project Reflection

- How close is what you are building to what you had in mind at the outset of the project?
- What is turning out very different or much harder than you expected?
- What should you be testing by now? unit testing for "model" stuff for sure 
    - order & order details work together
    - order status updates properly as order is built/cooked/fulfilled
    - outstanding orders data correct
    - outstanding cooking orders correct
    - orders can't be fulfilled until cooked
    - you may have more :)
- Do you have functional testing in places? a p[lan for it?
    - typical usecases for each ordering, cooking & admin
- **We will take a look at your latest build and the unit testing you have made, 
& offer our observations and/or suggestions**


##Submission

One member of each team should add a readme note in the session 10 dropbox,
answering the above.

Your submission should be ready by 13:30, as the order we conduct reviews
may be different than last week!
