#Lesson team02 - Project Planning
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Introduction

There are two extreme levels/strategies for project planning:

- Formal - rigorous rules, artifacts. 
Typified by Critical Path Method (**CPM**) or Project Evaluation & Review Technique (**PERT**).
Certification possible.
- Informal - when done one task, OMG what else do we have to do

We will be practicing Agile project management, a responsible blend of the two :)  
_Heads up: you will be building a WBS diagram and a precedence/network diagram during lab._

We will borrow some terminology and practices from formal project management,
which this lesson explores. I am bolding the terminology that will matter. 

_Heads up: being  familiar with the terminology herein will help with prospective employers or in an enterprise project.
Don't try to memorize them, though ... the most important ones will float to the top naturally._

_Note: the PERT method uses more complicated activity templates as the boxes inside
a diagram, with low/high/likely duration estimates. It is used to derive the
likelihod that a project will finihs by a target date._

##You know what a project is...

- Goal oriented - has a specific end in mind from the beginning
- Involves the coordination of interrelated activities
- Has a beginning and end
- Each project is unique

###How Do You Measure Project Success?

- On Time
- On Budget
- Meet or Exceed Objectives
- Team Member Satisfaction

###How Do You Get There?

Traditional view:
	
Project management, is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to describe, organize, oversee and control the various project processes.

_Notice that it is all about control_

##Project Management Activities

The traditional approach involves a number of activities:

- Develop a detailed project plan 
- Oversee the execution of the project plan
- Plan, define, and manage project scope 
- Create a detailed schedule, allocate resources, and budget costs
- Develop a quality plan and carry out quality assurance and quality control activities
- Perform organizational planning, manage staff acquisitions and promote team development
- Identify risks, prepare risk mitigation plans and execute contingency actions

_Notice the lack of technical skills, and the requirement of working with people._

##The Basic Functions of Project Management

It is normal to plan these over time.
Project management involves:
- Initiating
    - Getting approval and corporate support for the project;
    - Start the planning;
- Planning 	(this is what we are focusing on today)
    - Decide what needs to be done, by whom, and when;
- Organizing
    - Get all resources & people together and start executing the plan
- Implementing
    - Put the plan into action; Do the work;
- Monitoring / Controlling / Tracking / Oversight
    - Monitor progress; resolve issues; rework plans as needed
- Wrap-up
    - Review the project to identify successes & failures;
    - Need to know how to improve next time round;

##Project Planning Artifacts

The following artifacts are typically produced during the planning phase:

- Schedule
- Milestones (other than imposed)
- Budget (if not imposed)
- Roles and Responsibilities
- Deliverables
- Risks analysis

###Project Planning Phase: Inputs

The inputs to the planning process depend on when in the business cycle the planning takes place. 

Typically include:
- Statement of work, contract, or product vision
- Some level of requirements
- People (resources)
- **Project constraints** (time, money, quality, technology)

_Note: the same constraints apply with agile planning, but not necessarily with the
same interpretation or priorities. Details on Monday!_

##TEAM Based Planning

Traditional planning is done by a project planner or **project manager**.
Modern practices lean more towards team planning.

_Note: "project manager" is a real job title, with [certification](https://www.pmi.org/certifications)
available!_

###Traditional Approach to Planning

- a Project Manager is assigned to the project
- Project Manager creates a schedule for the project
- people are assigned to the project team 
- Team tries to work to the schedule

Typical results:
- the team never really buys in to the schedule 
- lip service is given to tracking and oversight needs
- project goals and objectives vary at different levels within the organization

###Motivation for Team Based Planning	

Based on the premise:  
The people who are affected by the plan should be involved in the preparation of the plan. This helps people take an interest in the project, and take “ownership” of the plan.

###How is this Team Based Planning Different from Traditional planning?

The TEAM is part of the PROCESS

Investing time on team relationships and individual values pays big dividends

The PROCESS builds the TEAM

##Fundamental Planning Concepts

- Those affected should be involved
- We must set realistic goals and tasks
- Always improve on the past
- Alternatives are always available
- Work in a team, not as individuals
- Plan, act, monitor, re-plan continuously

###Principles of Team Based Planning

Planning is done by the team, not the project manager
- Project manager acts as facilitator and/or record keeper

Goals of team based planning:
- create a plan (and associated schedule)
- get commitment from team members …

Planning is done in meetings
- Include entire team
- Included parties with an interest
- Don’t delegate planning to a person
- Sub-divide the planning as needed 

###Side Effects of Team Based Planning

- As people work together to plan, they discover the true form of the project
- Discussion among team members highlights risks, omissions, concerns etc, leading  to a better plan
- Schedule is more valid since it was created by the people who know what has to be done
- Ability to move “pieces” of the project allows alternatives to be explored
- Planning is like a dress rehearsal; afterwards everyone should know how the project is expected to unfold, and understand their part in the project
- Much greater commitment to the plan because key players are involved in the creation of the plan – so they have a sense of ownership
- All team members are working towards the same goals and objectives, as they helped define them

##Planning is done in meetings …

We make use of formal planning meetings …

Facilitated
- Each meeting has a facilitator who ensures equal contribution, and focuses the team on the task at hand
- Use round table, or direct involvement

Formal minutes
- Each meeting has a scribe, who is NOT the facilitator
- Results are documented so that records of decisions are kept

Work towards consensus
- “consensus” means “everyone agrees”
- Do not use “votes” – democracy is not the same as consensus
- Do not use “forced acceptance” – you cannot mandate “buy-in”
- Use principled negotiation techniques as needed

Employ active brainstorming techniques

###Meeting Skill 1: Brainstorming

You know how to do this :)

###Meeting Skill 2: Achieving Consensus

This is still a possible confusion source.

The goal is to arrive at a decision that is best for everyone in the group, not just a majority.

The final decision should achieve the desired objective.

Some guidelines:
- Avoid win / lose situations (use your principled negotiation skills)
- Consider differences in opinion as strength, and build on them
- Avoid just giving up and capitulating to keep things moving;
- Don’t try to eliminate conflict; conflict is good, allow it to emerge and build on it; challenge yourselves to find a solution that everyone likes
- Always repeat back what you hear, so that you are sure you understand what was intended
- Put your cards on the table early; make sure everyone knows your opinion so it can be included in the agreement

##Team Based Planning Meeting


As discussed, all planning will be done through meetings, with everyone involved.

The goal of the meetings is to come up with a complete plan for the project.

###How the planning meeting works …


Planning meeting is typically 1-2 days (depending on project size); for our size project, today's lab is sufficient

Follows the steps of planning (next slide)

Best to keep it “low tech”, because we want people actively involved

##The Planning Process

Establish the need for the project
- Define **project goals** + terms of reference

Establish project objectives
- List the high level requirements
- Clarify project constraints
- Identify major players, staff, **roles** and **responsibilities**

Identify major areas or categories of work

List the main activities and decisions in each category of work

Prepare a master network diagram
- Assign resources to activities, and rework the network diagram as needed to balance workload
- Make time estimates for each activity (duration)
- Rework the schedule as needed to meet any schedule, staff or quality targets

__Notes:  
- "project goals" are deliverables used to determine success (did we meet them); agile
tends to focus more on feature sets.
- "roles" are often narrowly interpreted per the PMI certifications
- "responsibilities" in agile include the client and not just the development or planning team

###Planning Concepts Conclusion?

Those affected should be involved

**E.P.  =  Q x A**

effectiveness of plan = quality x acceptability

##Consider a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

Organize the work to be done, meaningfully

Can provide the base data for your network diagram

Don't need to estimate time needed until you prepare your diagram

<img class="scale" src="/pix/planning/wbs.png"/>

_Note: WBS is the starting point for an agile project diagram_

##Prepare a Master Network Diagram

Use the Critical Path Method (CPM)

CPM manages relationships and dependencies between activities

CPM allows you to focus on risks / timeline

WBS is a good starting point (add estimates and order)

<img class="scale" src="/pix/planning/diagram1.png"/>

_Note: CPM calculations are useful to determine a project's
completion date, before you start playing with resource allocation._

_Note 2: agile uses a number of different diagrams, as you will
see on Monday!_

###What's Wrong with a Gantt chart?

<img class="scale" src="/pix/planning/gantt.png"/>

It shows planned project work over time, but does not portray the relationshipo
between tasks or communicate the flow of work in a project.

_Note: Gantt charts are popular because "old school"_

###Network Diagram Basics

Flow from start to finish is always left to right

Flows cannot double back (**no cycles** allowed)

Lines that cross should have “bridges”

All projects should have a start and an end
- What is the first activity?
- What is the very last activity?


###The Basics of CPM: No Cycles Allowed

<img class="scale" src="/pix/planning/diagram2.png"/>

_Note: same applies to agile. A task, once done, stays done.
If you want to repeat it, that would be a second, duplicate activity._

###How to deal with iterations ...

<img class="scale" src="/pix/planning/diagram3.png"/>

##Network Diagram Definitions

- **Duration** - not effort, but actual scheduled periods of time (typically days, 
but probably lab shifts for this course) for the activity
(effort is a measurement like person-hours ... it does not include down time)
- **Early start** - earliest time an activity can start based on activities before it, lag, dependencies etc
- **Late start** - latest time an activity can start without affecting the completion date for the project
- **Early finish** - earliest time an activity can finish based on CPM time calculations
- **Late finish** - the latest time an activity can finish without extending the completion date
- Total **slack** (total float) - the difference between an activities EF and LF (ie: total amount the activity can be delayed w/o affecting project completion date)
- Free slack (free float) - the amount of time an activity can be delayed w/o affecting another activity (ie: difference between EF and the LS of a dependent activity)
- **Critical path** - the longest path though the network.
    - no activity on the path can be delayed without extending the overall project completion date
    - activities on the critical path have a total float of zero
- Lag - fixed relationships between activities
    - Finish-Start (succeeding activity cannot start until preceding activity finishes)
    - Finish-Finish (succeeding cannot finish earlier than preceding activity)
    - Start-Start (succeeding activity cannot start until preceding activity has started)

_Notes:_  
- Formal planning is much more obsessed with "duration", with some practicioners
insisting on exactness to the nearest 15 minutes. Agile tends to be looser: small, medium or large activities :) 
- start and finish dates are usually calculated and reported by the tool(s) you are using,
whether agile or formal_
- "slack" means the same, but is not so critical to "agile" - we have plans for any "spare time" in an iteration
- a good agile tool determines this automatically, "schedules" accordingly, and shows you what is behind schedule
- "lag" makes sense, as a term, but I have not seen it in the agile tools I have used; the agile approach tends to use smaller activities, so that you can use "normal" relationships

###Time Calculations

Make one pass forward, calculating early start and early finish times.

Make a second pass backwards, calculating late finish and late start times.

The difference between them gives you an activity's slack time.

##Wrapup

There you have the basics of project planning, with a bunch of non-essential pieces left out.
Absorbing these won't make you an excellent project manager, but it will give you
a fighint chance of having an intelligent conversation with one :)
