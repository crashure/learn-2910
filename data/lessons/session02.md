#Session 2 Survey Results	
	
Responses for the survey follow, with the number of similar
responses shown to the right of a response.
	
There were 20 responders.
	
I have interpreted and aggregated some of the results.
	
##What are topics from the lesson that *you* feel need more or better explanation?	

- Workload Assignments	8 _See below_
- How to resolve conflicts within a team?	6 _See below_
- Team agreement clarification	5  _Samples posted_
- Stages of Team Development	4  _In class_
- What happens when?	4  
_You decide that, (1) as part of your project plan and (2) as part of each agile iteration._
- Mission Statement	3  _In class_
- Desired Best Practices	2  _Agile & Gitflow_
- Process Review	2  _In class_
- Are there any hard requirements for the website we are creating.  Like usability on mobile devices, required features,  etc.	
_The project writeup is evolving, and will be complete for Thursday, when you create your project plan._
- Are we going to mark others based on the agreement?	_No._
- How much time to be spent brainstorming?	
_Today is the last formal day. You will use the brainstorming technique yourselves,
as the project progresses, to resolve conflicts and make decisions (for instance, 
what to do next)._
- How to pace each part of the thinking process	 
_There is no "right" answer for this. It is my hope that you can get proficient 
enough with brainstorming to be able to use the technique as a 5-10 minute
way to resolve most of the teamwork problems that arise._
- I would like it that for activities what we are supposed to be doing is clarified (sometimes didnt know what to do)	  
_Some of the "directions" are purposefully vague. Each team should "evolve" its
own practices or strategies, within general guidelines. As mentors, we nudge
you towards strategies we believe will have benefit.  
Remember key management concept #2!_
- Is the Facilator role different from the leader role?  Like is a facilator a sergeant to the a officer (leader).	  
_Yes. A "facilitator" keeps meetings on track, while a "Leader" would normally be the spokesperson
for a team. Another role coming up is "Captain", who will be the only team
member with admin permission for a team repository._
- What if we later want to change somethings in the team agreement?	  
_That is possible. The team agreement establishes expectations and agreed-to practices
for the team, and those may change as the team and project evolve._
- What is a good team	_Productive & happy? See "workload" below._
- Will each iteration need to be fully functionional, or is it okay to have placeholders for some functions?	  
_Each iteration needs to be "non-broken". That does not mean it has to be fully functional.  
Only those iteration tasks that are completed would be included in the "deployable"
version of the product at that stage. Incomplete tasks get carried over to the next
iteration._

##Workload Assignments

This was the largest area of concern, expressed in the survey.

You are trying to anticipate the different skills you expect will be needed
to complete your project, and to make sure that you have them covered.

Negotiation might be needed if everyone wants to do one of the jobs, or if no one
wants to do one of the jobs.

The actual work done during an iteration may or may not follow your planned
workload, but the plan gives you a starting point for assigning iteration tasks.

Think of the workload assignments as choosing the different roles in your team,
or perhaps choosing who will be the tie-breaker for a related issue.

- What if someone is not so good in programming but good at team work.  
_Either have them agree to bump their programming skills, if that is what the team
figures is needed, or have them in more of a "team" role than a "programming" one._
- "Negotiate tentative workload assignments" -> Who has the final say on this? 
It is quite a subjective topic to reach a happy medium if there is a discrepancy  
_Agreed. Final say should be up to the team - resolve this using brainstorming
techniques, a.k.a. problem-solving!  
Possible last resort: agree that the team "leader" may rule arbitrarily
if you cannot resolve an issue otherwise._
- How would I determine if the workload assigned to me and my teammates is fair and even?  
_You won't know for sure until the project is complete.
In the meantime, a process review will help determine if everyone is
accepting of the planned workload, or if anyone feels hard done by.
*Do* the process review for this, so that all team members get a chance
to have a say, and don't get steamrolled into an undesirable position._
- When we negotiate workload assignments, will their be specific given 
assignments we are negotiating or do we pick/make then up.  
_Sure. Seriously, this is a plan, and you are trying to cover all the bases.  
The plan cannot include everything from the get go, and you will
be changing things around a bit with each iteration.  
Agile practices will determine the task assignment during any iteration._

Your workload assignments will get better over time, as you build up
an experience bank. Until then, ask your mentors for advice :)

With a team of five, **one** natural workload assignment that jumps out at
me (generally) is to have a pair of developers working on "front-end" stuff, another
pair of developers working on "back-end" stuff, and the fifth team member
tasked with managing the repository and testing everything senseless.
With a team of four, the same would apply, except that one of the team members
will have the additional responsibility/role of managing the team's repo.  
_Your mileage may vary. Results are stereotypical but not guaranteed.
Developers will be harmed as they build experience.
Patience, young padawans!_


##Conflict Resolution

This was the second biggest concern from the survey.

One goal of the brainstorming practice, is to give you a technique that you can use
for problem resolution without arguing for hours over an issue.

If the technique gives a tie vote, you could always have the "leader" make the call,
assuming you agreed ahead of time to handle things this way.

If the technique results in a split vote (1 or more dissenting from the majority),
you could agree ahead of time that a simple majority vote will be used for
such situations. Or you could split the issue into smaller ones, which might
be more easily resolved (the salami technique).

- What if after the brainstorming and agreement of all of these, a member does not commit to these agreements?  How can we incorporate them and get them back in track?  
_In the worst case, fire them. Or follow pro sports - trade them to another team for a more compatible player.  
If a team member won't agree to the team agreement, they do not belong on the team.  
If a team member decides partway through the project that they won't abide by the
team agreement, fire them. If they end up without a team, they will have a lot of work to
do on their own, and they won't get a good collaboration mark._
- What if problems can't be resolved?  
_It happens. That is why you have a conflict resolution process in the
team agreement, and signed off by everyone before a problem arises._
- How to solve a clash of ideas, where only one can be used?  
_Time permitting, try both (each would be caleld a "spike").
If you only have time for one, use the agreed-to conflict resolution process
to pick the path to pursue._

This may sound like a worn-out record, but your conflict resolution will get easier and/or 
better over time, as you build up
an experience bank. Until then, ask your mentors for advice :)

Let me tell you about a practice that worked for us ...
