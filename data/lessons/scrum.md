#Scrums
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

You need 'em, you want 'em! Every day!

##Daily Scrum

A daily scrum can be a stand-up meeting or a quick sit down.
It should take 5-15 minutes ... 5 if things are going well, 15 if the team needs 
to resolve something.

Three questions to answer:
-    What did you do yesterday?
-    What will you do today?
-    Are there any impediments in your way?

Who is included? the team, possibly your boss

This might sound very similar to a process review, hmmmmm.
The difference is that a process review addresses how the team
members are feeling individually, about their contributions and influence,
while a scrum addresses tasks.

Does this need to be formal and written?  
No ... although keeping a record of these, eg. in a Trello list, can
provide a "diary" of sorts, that can give the team a sense of progress.

Our project is small enough that recording daily scrums feels excessive.

##Iteration Scrum

An iteration scrum is likely to be a bit more formal, because it addresses more
work than would be done in a day.
It should take 15-60+ minutes, depending on the issues being encountered,
and the prioritizing of the client.

Three questions to answer:
-    What did you do this iteration just concluding?
-    What will you do during the next iteration?
-    Are there any impediments in your way?

Who is included? the team, your client (who might want to shift
priorities) and your boss (who might have to approve spending
more money to do things right).

This might sound very similar to a daily scrum, hmmmmm.
The difference is that an iteration scrum isn't just about what the team
is up to now, but instead looks to plan what the team will be up to for the next while.
If it looks like the project completion date or feature set might be in jeopardy,
you want to address that sooner rather than later!

Does this need to be formal and written?  
Not formal, but there should definitely be a record, as decisions are being made.

Our project is small, and the iterations are purposefully short, but
they should still be treated as potential pivot points, where the focus direction
could change.
