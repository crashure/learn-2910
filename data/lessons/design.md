#Agile Design
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

Traditional development calls for reams of design documents.
Agile says "design only what is needed".

What is needed? Basically, anything you want to get client approval for,
so that you have confidence that you will get paid for it :-/

Our project is small enough that you will probably get away with running stuff
by us. With a larger project, you need to be more formal, and this lesson
is meant to give you some ideas.

Below is an idea of how carried away you could get.
Very beautiful, and of course there would be supporting design
elements or documents for everything shown.
Yikes!

##How Much Do You Need?

Design communicates the vision for a product/project

You need some high level design to inform the participants

As user stories get accepted for an iteration, you need to know what will make the client happy.

##Information Design

The "creative" aspect of information design suggests

- Define product goals
- Define what the audience wants to do
- Define how product reaches audience
- Choose authoring tool
- Create convent inventory list
- Create project plan
- Organize content
- Produce content flowchart

Wow - that sounds formal, but is typical of a media-rich project.
Much of this will be in the hands of "creative" team members.

###Information Architecture

We are IT professionals, are we would be expected to come up with the
"information architecture" aspect of information design.

That includes:

- Sitemap
- Data Organization
- E.R.D.s
- Database schemas

You might notice that I am not including a set of rules for these.
That is something that each team chooses, based on the size, scope
and timeframe for a project.

For instance, a sitemap could be created in notepad, but you might want something just a bit fancier
if you expect the client to pay you the big bucks...

##Interaction Design

This is right out of your UX/UI course ...

- Usecase stories
- Navigation
- Interaction

The same tools you used for that would apply here, again with the time spent
and the fanciness of the design documents or visuals commensurate
with the project.

###Interaction Architecture

Some typical interaction design elements that become important in larger projects:

- Sequence diagrams
- Activity diagrams
- Storyboards

Storyboard examples follow in a section at the end.
Here is a sample seuqnce diagram, particularly appropriate when
you have a distributed system.

##Presentation Design

This can be a bottomless hole ...

- Define visual theme & style
- Design system of layouts
- Create structural elements
- Create control elements
- Integrate media elements
- Create prototype screens

How much do you need? enough to communicate your vision, if you are 
responsible for the presentation!

###Presentation Architecture

Even if you are not "doing" the presentation design, there are a few
things you cannot help but be involved with:

- Wireframe layouts
- UI Mockups
- Storyboards
- Stylesheets

Here is a sample mockup, vonforming to or implying a wireframe:

##Examples (continued)

Your design doesn't have to be super fancy.

Here is an example of a sketched website "idea". If the client approves it,
then you would proceed to a mockup. If they approve that, you can build it.

Here is an example that tries to pull everything together, and which
would need drill-down ability to see the different pieces on their own.
