#Session 4 Survey Results	
	
Responses for the survey follow, with the number of similar
responses shown to the right of a response.
	
There were 20 responders.
	
I have interpreted and aggregated some of the results.
	
##What are topics from the lesson that *you* feel need more or better explanation?	

- Agile Metrics	7  _In class_
- Can you explain "Kanban + Scrum" a little more	2  _In class_
- What is Sprint Backlog & Sprint	2  _In class_
- An image shows that Sprints are typically 30 days, how long will ours be for this project?	  _In class_
- Difference between the original Agile and the modern Agile	  
_"Modern agile" is a different interpretation, intended to motivate better._
- Four things the agile management is divided into.	  
_Referring to "modern agile"? arbitrary division & naming, based on empirical evidence_
- how do you determine an interval?	  
_An iteration length? Based on the project ... for instance, a six-week project might use
two-week intervals whereas a six-month one might use four-week intervals.
There is overhead for an interval (planning meeting, re-prioritizing, re-assigning),
so you don't want them too short, but you would not normally have iterations
longer than four weeks, for tighter project control._
- How do you find time to finish the additional tasks that become uncovered	  
_They get added to the backlog. The client prioritizes what to work on.
If additional tasks push the completion into additional iterations,
the client pays for them. If the client does not want to pay for them,
the project is done, delivering whatever was completed by the end of
the final paid iteration._
- how large or small of a timeframe does one use to measure with a burndown chart?	  
_Normally, iteration or project as a whole._
- How many iterations do we need for the project?	  
_See above. There is no "required" number - it depends on the size of
the project. I would expect a four-week project to have four one-week iterations,
because of the tight timeframe. I would expect a six-month project to have six
four-week iterations, but it could just as well have eight three-week ones._
- How to make the diagrams	  
_The tools we use do that for us :)_
- Iteration steps	  _In class_
- Need more elaboration on how the storyboard works. I don't know if I really got the process right.	  _In class_
- Phases of progress	  _In class_
- planning	  
_Planning is often more "traditional", as we did. Management is often more "agile",
and starts where planning leaves off. Planning what to do next is part of
project management, i.e. more operational in nature._
- Project timeline	  
_The tools will tell us how long a project will take, based on what we said
needed to be done for it and based on how implementation is progressing.
If a project scope creeps, you simply add iterations to provide for
the additional work :-/_
- The 24hour 30 day sprint diagram. I don't get it.	  _In class_
- Trello	  
_Trello is *one* of the tools commonly used in agile development and project
management. It *can* be used for the storyboard, but its purpose is
collaboration. PivotalTracker's purpose is to manage a project's
storyboard, but it *can* also be used for collaboration.  
These are not the only or necessarily the best tools, but they
were chosen for their simplicity and appropriateness to task._
- What do you do if there's errors that show up after you complete your project. 
Even though through your testing it never occurred. Like a rare bug or something.	  
_That would then be a different project, if the bugs were severe, or they
would be work that you or your boss would schedule for some of the "free time"
(20%?) you should be providing for planning purposes.  
If this is a defect, you would normally "eat" the cost of fixing it.
If this is a requirements deficiency, you would normally treat this as a separate project,
with the client expected to pay for it._
- What exactly does an agile iteration consist of, is it a complete working version of the project?	  _In class_
- What is agile granularity?	  
_This refers to how finely you want to break down the work in a project.
With a small project, "task" and "story" might be treated interchangeably.
With a larger project, you would probably think of a "story" containing multiple "tasks".  
PivotalTracker is story-based. If you want finer granularity, they provide for task
checklists as part of a story._
- What we consider the different modules of Ordering, Kitchen, and Admin "Epics" for our projects?	  
_That is a valid strategy. The usual interpretation of an "epic" is closest to a
"release", namely a set of stories that would be deployed at the same time.
If your project provides for rolling out the code in three stages,
then those would be the natural "epics" for the project._
- Why is there story backlog twice in scrum?	  
_There is a "sprint backlog" - those stories that are planned for the current
iteration but not started yet - and a "product backlog" - those stories that are planned
eventually, but which have not been selected for the current iteration._

##Other related questions

- Do we get time in class to work on project?	2  
_You *are* working on your project :)  
If your question refers more to coding during class, there will be some
provision for that, but most will be on "your" time, i.e. the hour or so
out of class for every hour in class that I mentioned at the outset
of the course.  
In the early part of the course, there are a number of tools and techniques we want
to pass on. As the course progresses, that will change to a few "tricks"
appropriate to the expected stage of your project.  
Towards the end, our role will be mostly mentoring, and you will have 
"more in-class time" to work on your project._
- Are there any easy to use tools for TDD of Javascript like JUnit for Java?	  
_I haven't used any myself, but two that seem highly regarded are 
[QUnit](https://qunitjs.com/) and 
[Mocha](http://unitjs.com/)._
- Are we gonna be required to use storyboards during the development of our web app?	  
_Er, that is *the way* that agile project management is portrayed._
- How do you mange the time effectively	  
_Stay on task. Complete higher priority tasks before easier ones.
Ask for help from your teammates or mentors, sooner rather than later 
(a good use for Trello). Code defensively, very defensively._
- How will we implement agile discipline in our project.	  
_Using a small set of helpful tools, and using gitflow workflow
for collaboration._
- What are other possible perspectives in project development (other than Modern agile)?	  
_That is a loaded question, with no objective answer.  
Having said that, the last three links at the end of the reading
for this week lead to "the New Methodology" (Martin Fowler) and "Large Scale Scrum"
(Craig Larman), as well as "Modern Agile" (Joshua Kerievsky).
I find them all interesting (subjectively). _
- What will we being other than the project?	  
_My goal is to help you learn some agile development and collaborative workflow
techniques. The project is an excuse to do this :)_
