##2. Workload Assignments

- You earlier identified experience that you bring to the team
- Brainstorm a reasonable set of skills needed
- Negotiate tentative workload assignments
- Record these...

- What about skill gaps?

##3. Desired Practices

- You earlier identified best and worst experiences with projects
- Brainstorm a handful of qualities or behaviours that are highly desirable
- Record these...

Eg. We will not keep concerns to ourselves; we will bring cookies to meetings

##5. Why You Will Succeed

- Brainstorm a handful of qualities or behaviours that will make your team likely to succeed
- Record these...

Eg. we are awesome; we work well together

##6. What You Want

- You identified earlier some of the things you wanted from your participation in the team
- Brainstorm a handful of wants, with team consensus
- Record these...

Eg. know my teammates better; dominate the world

##1. Mission Statement

- Finally, the “executive summary”
- Brainstorm qualtities, phrases or outcomes that belong in a mission statement
- Record these...

##Artifact(s)

The end result of all of this is a team agreement document.

This is between the team members, and not your client.
Your boss may have observations and critique, but is not part of the agreement.
