##What are topics from the lesson that *you* feel need more or better explanation?	

- CPM	3  _In class_
- Work Breakdown Structure	3  _In class_
- **Network Diagrams**	3  _In class_
- Prepare a Master Network Diagram	2  _In class_
- Whats the best way to apply a WBS if you think of additional crutial tasks half way through development?	2  
_WBS guides task creation, and the categories would not normally change during a project.  
Additional tasks will almost always be discovered, and they get added to the pool of work to do.  
Agile adjusts to this, while traditional planning suggests backing up a step or three._
- desired practices	  _In class_
- Even though a gantt chart doesn't show the relationship between tasks is it still suitable to use in order to give a general understanding of what is going to happen when?	  
_Absolutely. Many tools provide multiple views of the project tasks, including a Gantt chart_
- Gantt chart	  _In class_
- How do we perform a risk analysis?	  
_Without going all formal, that is something that you evolve with experience._
- In the "Meetings" section it is said 'Use principled negotiation techniques as needed', is this just finding middle ground, how would you apply these tactics?	  
_This is the brainstorming and/or achieving concensus addressed earlier._
- More information about the EP = QxA formula(seems important)	  
_The premise is that team involvement will improve acceptability more than a professional project manager would improve quality.  
Related: team involvement will result in better quality because of better engagement._
- motivation	_Related to the point above :)_
- Network Diagram bridges	_Just a technique for diagram clarity_
- **The Planning Process**	  _In class_
- What does TF means in the Time Calculations diagram?	 _Total float_
- What is acceptability? (in the plan effectiveness formula)	_How likely the "plan" is to be accepted by the team members"_
- what is meant by pass in time calculations?	  _In class_
- When explaining the Typical Approach to Planning results it says "lip service is given to tracking and oversight needs", what exactly does this mean?	  
_Many typical approaches don't provide for practical tracking or oversight - they get caught up in formal processes._
- Why are meeting minutes recorded?	_To provide a record of decisions made. 
Particularly useful if there are disputes or if a new member joins the team._

##Other related questions

- Does team agreement actually used in real job? _Yes. Also known as a project charter, or part of terms of reference._
- For a group of beginners that's developing medium to large software, it is sometimes hard to know all the tasks for the project and estimate time for them. If that is the case, do we need to spend more time in planning?  
_Only within reason! Agile tools will help, and you will get better at estimating over time._
- How is WBS related to CPM? _Helps us uncover tasks that are used in CPM._
- How to work better in a team?  _$64 question, and the reason for the team building sessions earlier this week.
Practice will improve your skills._
- integrating the system _Later!_
- Is it easier to do **team planning vs traditional planning**?  _Yes & no ... in class!_
- Is the Time Calculation a guideline to see how well the team is progressing or is it a strict time line that should be followed?  
_It is helpful to ensure that you have a plan to complete on time. Reality gets in the way during implementation, unfortunately._
- Not sure if related, but will we get more details on what to do with the project? or is that in future classes    _In class_
- Prioritizing the work in each task _You decide_
- What are some recommended ways to track progress and scheduling? _Coming Monday_
- What if the planning stage takes longer due to low cohesion, clash of ideas, and many other factors? Should the project manager take over if this is the case?  
_You could, but at the expense of acceptability. See earlier answer._
- What is the purpose of the three squares in each CPM activity?   _In class_
- What's wrong with using democracy to reach decisions if that was agreed by all to use?  
_Nothing! Concensus is preferable, if possible._
- When planning roles in a project, how do you know you've covered all available roles? What happens if something unexpected comes up? Who takes care of it? How to manage with current workload?  
_Experience & agile development. Use the force, Luke!_
- When resolving conflict, how long is "too long"? (When do you finally need to reach consensus to minimize delays?)  
_Up to the team, and the importance of the issue causing a conflict. No wasy answer._
- Would skipping a step in the planning process be detramental or hurt the project?  
_With experience, you will find that some steps can be standardized (eg WBS), but each step should
still be visited, no matter how much experience you have, to make sure you don't forget something.
It is easier to fix problems earlier in a project rather than later._
