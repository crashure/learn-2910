#Session 5-6 Survey Results	
	
Responses for the survey follow, with the number of similar
responses shown to the right of a response.
	
There were 15 responders.
	
I have interpreted and aggregated some of the results.
	
##Which of the gitflow techniques we practiced today caused big problems?	

- committing to develop instead of features  
_You need to be aware, at all times, of the branch you are working on.  
This is a problem for seasoned gitters too! _

_The walkthroughs that I posted should address all of the following points.
Let me know soonest if additional clarification is needed!_

- Synchronization	4
- adding additional remote repo	
- cloning/upstream	
- Creating and using a new branch instead of using develop	
- I did not get how to solve the conflicts witht the base branch.	
- I didn't understand how to sync my fork with the team's repo.  Now I do though.	
- I had a bit of confusion as to which branches we were supposed to push to, but that has mostly been resolved.	
- I had problems with the upstream remote.	
- I know a few people had issues with not realizes that they could update thier commits without having to close it and re-open a new one	
- I think the upstream to fix the merge was the only thing that I coulnt fix	
- I was confused between the branches, which one to use.	
- Lots of thing doesn't work and not sure what to do to fix problem	
- Merge	
- Pull	
- Some issue with resolving conflicts and trying to rollback changes.	
- To me (and my group I believe), just seeing how the flow actually worked visually in terms of the branches, and how all the systems were actually interacting.	
- Understanding what the merge conflict was trying to emphasize (the signs and words).	
- Whether to create a pull request from an open feature branch or from the develop branch.	


##Which sections of the writeup need improving, or adding if they are missing?

- In branch do we actually have to commit.  
_You should always be working in a topic/feature branch, and thus committing in that branch_
- the function of a git command  
_Are you looking for a comprehensive list of the git commands and what each does?
I have added a list of cheat sheets for Git and Markdown, to the resources page_
- Which branch to push the changes to  
_When you push, you are pushing a local branch to your repo, resulting
in a new or updated branch with the same name_

_The walkthroughs that I posted should address all of the following points.
Let me know soonest if additional clarification is needed!_


- Could you do a demonstration of how to integrate your fork and upstream into an IDE?
- Detailed instructions
- How to get started on the lab
- How to solve the conflicts with the base branch.
- I believe the write up was quite good, but it was a lot of text so I don't believe a lot of people actually read it. I really just takes some practice getting used to gitflow.
- I spent a lot of today relearning Github because I haven't used it in awhile :) And I know some people needed an entire walkthrough of the entire thing
- I think a step by step would be helpful on each section (Like type this, then this, then this). There's a lot of confusing codes that I don't know what or how to use them.
- I think the writeup was good, but we probably could've used more of a presentation-based walkthrough to help understand what the commands all did.
- If you could add more information for the synchronizing
- Maybe a little clearer for synch
- more instructions on which commands to execute in which order
- There were a number of the basic console commands missing such as "git clone".
