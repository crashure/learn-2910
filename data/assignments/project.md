#Mini-Project - Fast Food Outlet
ACIT2910 - BCIT - Spring 2017

##Project Overview

The purpose of the project is to let you apply the techniques 
and skills from earlier courses, using agile development and
collaborative workflow.

In teams of four or five, you will be building a small but complete webapp, 
in this case to support a fast food outlet on a distant planet. 

This will be done in four or five iterations, with specific expectations for 
the deliverables and the process used for each stage. 
There will be one or more graded deliverables for each stage.
