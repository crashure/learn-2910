##Risk Analysis 

What is probability of a negative event?
-Probability of a negative event is quite possible, since we can get stuck while coding.
-It is also possible that we can run out of time.

What can be done to lower this probability?
-Do the Internet research to learn about coding techniques we need.
-Get help from the instructors, friends and classmates.
-Manage and spend time effectively and do not waste time to avoid running out of time.-

What is impact of a negative event?
-Not being able to finish the project on time (or finish the project on time but with poor quality).
-Get lower mark.
-Failing the course.
-Conflicts between our team mates (i.e. blaming on each other, physical/verbal fights).
-Discouragement
-Feeling hopeless
-Disappointment in ourselves

If event happens, how do we minimize the negative impact?
-Get help as early as possible, that way we can save time
-Help each other with our own knowledge and experiences
-Make a group meeting and brainstorm
-Re-management/improvement of tasks and schedules

_Note: All coding and testing tasks will be done iteratively in the same two weeks. First we code, and then test, change code and re-test, and so on. That’s why they all have the same duration._
